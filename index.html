<!--This is the Biography -->
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p> My name is Jason Salinas, this my first time taking programming classes and I'm very excited to be taking this classes and I'm looking forward for the challenges ahead of me. The reason I'm taking programming classes is because when I was in 7th grade we took a programming course for a week and it caught my attention and ever since then I wanted to get a career in programming. So my future goals is to get a job in programming and be able to make my parents proud. </p>
